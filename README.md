## Regularized Linear Regression and Bias v.s. Variance


### Part 1: Regularized Linear Regression

Implementing regularized linear regression
to predict the amount of water flowing out of a dam using the change of water level in a reservoir.

### Part 2: Bias-variance

Implementing code to generate the learning curves that will be useful in debugging learning algorithms.
ie finding out the bias vaiance relation between training dataset and cross-validation dataset.
